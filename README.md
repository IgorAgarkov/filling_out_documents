# filling_out_documents
This script generates a sequence of documents by filling out a template and using an individual number for each file. The number has the form "123-22", where 123 is the ordinal number (the initial and final values are set), 22 is the last digits of the year. The script uses today's date, and takes the name of the product model from the file name. The document number is generated from the sequence specified by the variables num1 (initial value), num2 (final value). The number of generated documents is equal to the number of numbers in the sequence.
